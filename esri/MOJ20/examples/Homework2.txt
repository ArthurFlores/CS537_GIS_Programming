Homework 2 Instructions:
   This hw is intended to gain familiarity with the Java awt/swing
   packages.

   Create 4 or 5 buttons, each initialized with some picture of our
   Java friend Duke.  Look online for Duke pictures in .jpg or .gif
   format.  You can put both text and a picture on a button, but you
   must include a picture.  The buttons can be placed on a JPanel,
   or used in a grid layout manager.

   Then when a button is clicked, open up a JDialog window as your
   action event handler and do something related to the picture on
   that button.   For example you could have some text that explains
   the picture.   One thing to do is to make all the text and pictures
   related to a single theme, e.g. sports, music, movies, books, so forth.
   For example you could use Duke pictures as a way to describe your 5
   favorite movies.   If you read ahead, you could use links to the web,
   include movie trailers from You Tube, etc.

   It would be best to code a single dialog window extension and vary
   what it contains, rather than writing code for 4 or 5 such window
   extensions.

   The due date is 9/29, and you will hand in hard copy of your Java code,
   and also demo your work, on a laptop, to a team of graders. Class may
   be extended to allow time for demos.
